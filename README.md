# howlerjs_demo

This is a quick demo that I put together for a 5-minute lightning talk I did on howler.js, a cross-browser JavaScript library for web audio.

You can check out the slide deck at https://www.slideshare.net/kgentner/howlerjs-lightning-talk

If you would like to view and play the code, you will need to have node.js, grunt, and bower installed.

Then run these commands:

First:
```sh
$ npm install
```

Second:
```sh
$ bower install
```

Third:
```sh
$ grunt build:dev
```
Afterwards, you can run the server.js from node (or currently just open up the index.html file in the subsequent build folder).
